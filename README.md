This repository contains my notes from when we got our dog, Luna, trained. These are my personal notes, in digital form, and I am in no way advocating their use or accuracy. Any usage is the readers own responsibility. 

# Day 1 - HA (what does that stand for?)

12 weeks old at first session

Have a schedule! What time do they eat, what time do they go to bed?

## HA

The premise of this step is to have the leash on the dog, and to prevent them from training unwanted behaviors. 
We put on the leash and keep them in acceptable areas, like the living room. Times that we enter HA mode?

- When people come to visit, put on the leash, and prevent the dog from running to the door when people knock or come inside. 
- Cooking & Eating
- Cleaning
- Gym

## Crate Homework
- 15x a day, put treats in crate, put more in when she's in the crate
- Shut & immediately open when she goes in and doesn't immediately leave
- Put in a remarkably high value reat
    - Bully stick
    - Raw bone (freeze it)
    - Frozen Kong w/broth & food inside
    - Rope toy soaked in broth
    - Old rag wet & frozen
    - Snuggle mat with food in it
- No naps before bedtime
- Put TV on while in crate

## Potty

Use a diary (Dog Assistant for example) to track what time they pee, poop, sleep, eat, drink
when is the 'witching hour', when do they get the zoomies, track unproductive let-outs (didn't pee or poop),
and productive ones (what, when, where). If you give them the same schedule, they will likely keep the same schedule.
Expect 8-9 pees per day. 

When to let them out:
- immediately after eating or drinking
- 30 minutes after that
- Right after they're really hyper
- Right after waking up

## Marker Word & Starting Training 

- Choose a marker word; Something two syllables that can be drawn out; We chose _Bingo_
- **NEVER REPEAT A COMMAND**
    - Repeating a command lets the dog think it doesn't need to listen the first time. 
        - In retrospect, I find that using _"Boop boop boop boop boop boop"_, just means they mainly listen for the alliteration. 
- Immediately after successfully performing a command, marker word, and treat. 
    - "Luna, Sit! _Boop boop boop_, BINGO!!!!"  
- "_Name_ Sit!" (ex. "Luna, Sit!")
    - To train sit, put a treat in your hand, and make the following gesture: ðŸ¤Œ 
    - Put hand in front of dogs nose and raise your hand. In order to continue to look up and see your hand, the dog will need to sit.
- Dogs are bad at generalizing. "Sit" in a quiet bedroom doesn't have the same meaning as "Sit" on a busy street. It's 
important to train them in a variety of locations to help them understand that the command IS the same in all those places. 

## Homework Week 1

- Potty tracking
- Crate Homework defined above
- Charge marker word: 6x a day per person
    - Charging a marker word is simply saying it in a **high pitched and excited** voice, then immediately giving a treat
- Luna, Sit: 10x per day
- Name Game: 10x per day
- 5 names and 5 sits in 5 different places: 1x per day

# Day 2 -
